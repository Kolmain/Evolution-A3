Rescue units from the hands of the enemy.<br>
________________________<br>
<br>
A few moments ago we got a distress call from a UH60 going down in the North East of the island. Your mission is to go to the location search for the pilots and eliminate any resistance in the area.<br>
________________________<br>
<br>
Obj 1: Locate missing pilot<br>
Obj 2: Clear the area<br>
Obj 3: Lead the pilot to evac<br>
<br>
The pilot will only follow the leader of the squad once the area is clear.<br>
