Evolution-A3 is a remake of the popular Armed Assualt (ArmA) mission, Evolution Blue by KilJoy.
Evolution-A3 features all of the original gameplay mechanics, either in their original form, redesigned by myself, or with similair community content replacing the functionality of the original outdated code. 

# Features

  - All features can be *disabled/enabled* via **mission parameters**.
  - AI units can be recruited via **bon_recruit_units** at the staging base via *action menu*, and airdropped in the field via *BI's communication menu*.
  - Dynamic view distance settings with **CHVD** can be set via action menu in the staging base.
  - HALO insertions using **ATM_airdrop** via action menu in the staging base.
  - Player loadout saved to user profile and modified via BI's **Virtual Arsenal**.

> The overall goal of this project is to bring Evolution Blue up to ArmA 3 standards while preserving as much original gameplay as possible. Minor additions such as Revive and Support Assets that delineate from the origional concept should be added with optional paramters.
