Evolution-A3 is a remake of the popular Armed Assualt (ArmA) mission, Evolution Blue by KilJoy.
Evolution-A3 features all of the original gameplay mechanics, either in their original form, redesigned by myself, or with similair community content replacing the functionality of the original outdated code. 

# Features

  - All features can be *disabled/enabled* via **mission parameters**.
  - AI units can be recruited via **bon_recruit_units** at the staging base via *action menu*, and airdropped in the field via *BI's communication menu*.
  - Dynamic view distance settings with **CHVD** can be set via action menu in the staging base.
  - HALO insertions using **ATM_airdrop** via action menu in the staging base.
  - Player loadout saved to user profile and modified via BI's **Virtual Arsenal**.
  - The **original Evolution** sounds!
  - **BI's dynamic groups** interface can be used via action menu at the staging base or at anytime by pressing 'U'.
  - **Meatball's randomWeather2** generates random, MP-sync'd weather throughout the game.
  - **Quiksilver's cleanup** and BI's **wreck and corpse management** keeps the mission running smooth throughout the entire game.
  - Overall unit management moved to **UPSMON** for complex AI counterparts.
  - **Headless Client implementation** automatically detects and offloads AI to your HC.
  - **Pilot loadout requirements** enforced to fly aircraft, includes auto-switching of loadout if you're in the base.
  - **Modular sidemissions** that provide bonus points to all players, and extra bonus points to the players responsible for completing the task, including: CSAR, Defend, Attack, Defend the Base, Ambush, and AAA hunt.
  - **Officer and POW Capturing** in every area of operation for bonus points!
  - **OPFOR support assets** may be available at the AO including mortar, anti-air, CAS, and sniper support.

> The overall goal of this project is to bring Evolution Blue up to ArmA 3 standards while preserving as much original gameplay as possible. Minor additions such as Revive and Support Assets that delineate from the origional concept should be added with optional paramters.
