# Evolution-A3

Evolution-A3 is a remake of the popular Armed Assualt (ArmA) mission, Evolution Blue by KilJoy.
Evolution-A3 features all of the original gameplay mechanics, either in their original form, redesigned by myself, or with similair community content replacing the functionality of the original outdated code. 

  - Unit recruiting has been replaced with **bon_recruit_units**.
  - Dynamic view distance settings have been replaced with **CHVD**.
  - Paradrop insertions have been replaced with **ATM_airdrop**.
  - The **original Evolution** sounds are still used!
  - The group management interface is **BI's dynamic groups**.
  - The dynamic map-based weather was removed and currently **Meatball's randomWeather2** is being used.
  - The original cleanup code was replaced with **Quiksilver's cleanup**.
  - Overall unit management moved to **UPSMON** with minor script modifications (Hardcoded airdrops, etc).
  - Weapon crate replaced with **BI's Virtual Arsenal**, still working on proper whitelisting of equipment.
  - An MHQ was added using **CHHQ**.
  - *Experimental* **Headless Client implementation**, that accounts for disconnect/reconnect of HC automatically.
  - ArmA3 Content used in place of ArmA content.



> The overall goal of this project is to bring Evolution Blue up to ArmA 3 standards while preserving as much origional gameplay as possible. Minor additions such as Revive and Support Assets that delineate from the origional concept should be added with optional paramters.
