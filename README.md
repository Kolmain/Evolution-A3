# Evolution-A3

Evolution-A3 is a remake of the popular Armed Assualt (ArmA) mission, Evolution Blue by KilJoy.
Evolution-A3 features all of the original gameplay mechanics, either in their original form, redesigned by myself, or with similair community content replacing the functionality of the original outdated code.

  - **OPFOR support assets** may be available at the AO including mortar, anti-air, CAS, and sniper support.
