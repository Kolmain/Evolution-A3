# Evolution-A3

Evolution-A3 is a remake of the popular Armed Assualt (ArmA) mission, Evolution Blue by KilJoy.
Evolution-A3 features all of the original gameplay mechanics, either in their original form, redesigned by myself, or with similair community content replacing the functionality of the original outdated code. 

# Features

  - All features can be disabled/enabled via **mission parameters**.
  - Unit recruiting via **bon_recruit_units** at base, and airdropped in the field.
  - Dynamic view distance settings with **CHVD**.
  - HALO insertions using **ATM_airdrop**.
  - The **original Evolution** sounds.
  - Group management interface via **BI's dynamic groups**.
  - **Meatball's randomWeather2** generates random, MP-sync'd weather.
  - **Quiksilver's cleanup** keeps the mission running smooth throughout the entire game.
  - Overall unit management moved by **UPSMON** with minor script modifications (Hardcoded airdrops per AO, etc).
  - Weapon crate replaced with **BI's Virtual Arsenal**.
  - **CHHQ** provides a mobile HQ transport option.
  - **Headless Client implementation** automatically detects and offloads AI to your HC.
  - **Player Persistence** keeps players at their last known locations with their last known loadout in the event of a disconnect and rejoin of the same session.
  - **Pilot loadout requirements** enforced to fly aircraft, includes auto-switching of loadout if you're in the base.
  - **Modular sidemissions** that provide bonus points to all players, and extra bonus points to the players responsible for completing the task.
  - **Officer Capturing** in every area of operation.
  - **OPFOR support assets** may be available at the AO including mortar, anti-air, and sniper support.
  - All powered by **vanilla ArmA 3 content**.
  - Build structures in the field using **R3F Logistics**.



> The overall goal of this project is to bring Evolution Blue up to ArmA 3 standards while preserving as much original gameplay as possible. Minor additions such as Revive and Support Assets that delineate from the origional concept should be added with optional paramters.
